# React Native versus Swift
Two example to-do-list apps, which can creat events and mark as finished or removing them.

## Intro
- Develop OS: MacOS
- Target OS: iOS
- Development tool: Xcode 11
- Swift Language version: 4.2
- Simulator: iPhone 11 -- 13.2.2

## React Native part
### How to run on MacOS
- Install Xcode
- Clone this github
- Install Node 10 LTS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
- cd to the 'RN_todolist' directory
- ```$ npm install -g expo-cli```
- ```$ npm start```

Then you will see the EXPO webpage, and click 'Run on iOS simulator' to see the demo.
